# 🎗Frontend Developer Roadmap 🎗
#### ✨Front-end development, or client-side development, involves building the User Interface (UI) of a website or a web application, that determines how every part of a website will look and how it will work.

#### ✨Front-end development is a broad field with many nuances. But when we visit websites, the front-end is our first point of contact.

#### ✨However, the first step is discovering the specific topics that require your attention. Let’s dive into the topic, where I provide a roadmap for you to follow on your way to becoming a Front-end Developer in 2023!

## 🙋🏼‍♂️Some Basic Question's arises in Mind!

## Q:1):- Why are you choose front-end development?
#### ♦I believe that the main reason is that front-end development satisfies my need for creativity. It enabled me to easily put my ideas into digital form and get results back really quick. I still remember the first time I created an HTML page and opened it in the browser. A whole new world of possibilities appeared before my eyes. So, That I can choose Frontend development.

## Q:2):- Who is a Front-end Developer?
#### ♦Front-end development involves building a website or web application’s user interface (UI). It includes the application’s visual part and the user’s interaction. Whatever you see when you visit a website – different types of buttons and other UI elements, media, text, forms, animations, etc., are the fruit of a frontend developer’s work.

### A few words about my path from 0 to front-end developer
#### ♦I started my adventure with programming only in my 1st year of university – before that, I had no exposure to it. I just wanted to work in IT because technology has always fascinated me. I remember my first frontend class – we were tasked with writing a straightforward website in HTML and CSS. At that time, I didn’t even know what they were. I tried it, liked it, and decided what I wanted to do next in life. A year and a half later, I got my first Internship at RUDRAKSHA WELFARE FOUNDATION as a front-end developer in HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and also get Internship with IEEE Bombay Section.

## 🎡Where should you start as a Front-end Developer in 2023?
#### If you are at the beginning of your journey, even before you start writing actual code – learn the Basic Things before start Your Journey.

#### 💎Internet :- The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.
#### 💎What is HTTP?
#### 💎HTTP is the TCP/IP based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. HTTP follows a classical "Client-Server model" with a client opening a connection request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, that means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.
#### 💎Browsers :- A web browser is a software application that enables a user to access and display web pages or other online content through its graphical user interface.

## 🥉Fundamentals of Front End 
#### For stepping into Front-End Development, the most essential skills you should have are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These skills are the bare minimum to start with Front-End Development.

#### 🎯 HTML :)-> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used on the frontend and gives the structure to the webpage which you can style using CSS and make interactive using JavaScript.

#### 🎯 Semantic HTML :- Semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. In HTML, semantic element are the type of elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page such as `<form>`, `<table>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.

#### Example :-
```
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
          <head> 
                    <title> My First Website </title> 
          </head> 
          <body> 
                    <h1> This is heading level 1 </h1> 
                    <h2> This is heading level 2 </h2> 
                    <p> This is a normal paragraph </p> 
                    <i> This text will be italicized </i> 
                    <button> Click Me! </button> 
          </body> 
</html> 
```

Output :-

#### 🎯 CSS :)-> CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the language used to style the frontend of any website. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

#### Example :-
```
Code :-
HTML Part :-
<html> 
          <head> 
                    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> 
          </head> 
          <body> 
                    <h1> Using Tag Selector </h1> 
                    <p class = “text”> Using class selector </p> 
                    <i class = “text”> Using class selector again </i> 
                    <button id = “main-button”> Id selector </button> 
          </body> 
</html> 

CSS Part :-
body { 
          background-color: #fefa12; 
} 
 
h1 { 
          background-color: red; 
} 
 
.text { 
          margin: 10px; 
          font-family: ‘sans-serif’; 
} 
 
#main-button { 
          background-color: yellow; 
} 
```

Output :-

#### 🎯 JavaScript :)-> JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to your pages. Common examples that you may have seen on the websites are sliders, click interactions, popups and so on.

### 🎯 DOM Manipulation
#### 🎄 With HTML, you can create web pages with static layouts easily. However, you might need to build dynamic web pages that can change the layout on the fly.  For example, you might want to add, remove, or edit HTML elements after the web page has been loaded or you might want to modify the CSS styles of an element only when an event occurs. Such dynamic manipulation of your web page can be done using the Document Object Model (DOM) API, which is a set of APIs to control HTML and styling information. DOM Manipulation is a good-to-have skill that will help you in creating applications capable of updating the data or the layout of the page without reloading. DOM Manipulation can be done using JavaScript.  

### 🎯 How the Web Works?
#### 🎄 As a front end developer, you should have a basic idea of the working of the web and the different protocols for communication over the web. It is good to have the basic idea of how the internet works, how clients and servers interact, the Domain Name Server (DNS) and the components of a website i.e code files and assets. While it is not important to know all the communication protocols in detail, the basic knowledge of these protocols will help you develop secure websites which are critical nowadays. HTTPS and SSL are two of the secure communication protocols that are good to know.  

### 🎯 Responsive Design
#### 🎄 Responsive Web Design means creating websites that can be used on all types and sizes of devices. In today’s time where people use websites from all devices like laptops, large-screen computers, tablets as well as mobile phones, it becomes of utmost importance to develop responsive interfaces. This can be done using CSS Media Queries, where the style and layout of the web page change as per the device and screen size. Responsive Design automatically resizes, hides, shrinks or enlarges the components on a website.

### Step-1 :- Learn the Fundamentals - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
#### 🕹 As we saw earlier, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are three of the fundamental skills to become a front-end developer. Thus, you must make yourself familiar and comfortable with these three skills. This is the very first step in our front end road map. While HTML and CSS can be learned easily, JavaScript could be challenging, especially if you have no prior programming experience. You should get comfortable with other fundamental skills mentioned earlier - DOM Manipulation, Responsive Design, and working of the web. 

### Step-2 :- Learn any of the CSS Frameworks
#### 🕹 Once you are comfortable with the basics - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is time to move on to the next step in the roadmap for frontend, that is learning any of the CSS Frameworks. These frameworks would speed up the development process for you. One challenge that front end developers face is to maintain styling consistency in their web pages. CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, Tailwind, Semantic UI, Bulma, etc. make it easier to develop a consistent website.  They consist of several CSS stylesheets that are ready to use, allowing developers to save time that is otherwise spent in styling a website. These stylesheets are user-friendly and visually appealing and have built-in classes for common web elements like navbars, headers, footers, menus, etc. 

### Step-3 :- Learn any of the CSS Preprocessors
#### 🕹 CSS files can quickly become huge and difficult to maintain. Moreover, CSS doesn’t support some powerful programming features like variables and functions. Thus, we make use of CSS preprocessors that are scripting languages, extending the default capabilities of CSS. The extended CSS code is compiled and the output is the regular CSS file. With the help of CSS preprocessors, we can use logic in our script files like variables, functions, mixins, inheritance, nesting inheritance, and mathematical calculations. This automates repetitive tasks and reduces the number of errors, and creates reusable code. SASS/SCSS, Stylus, and Less are a few popular preprocessors.

### Step-4 :- Learn any JavaScript Framework
#### 🕹 JavaScript framework is pre-written code to support features and benefits beyond plain or vanilla JavaScript. As these frameworks are built on top of JavaScript, it is possible to achieve all the features of a framework with normal JavaScript as well. However, these frameworks offer enhanced functionality without writing the code from scratch. This is the reason why Front End Developers usually prefer using a framework over plain JavaScript. Angular, React, Vue.js, Meteor are some of the popular JavaScript frameworks for frontend development. You can also find specialized roles in React, Angular, or Vue.js. 

### Step-5 :- Learn State Management Libraries
#### 🕹 Along with any JavaScript Framework, it is recommended to learn State Management Libraries like Redux, VueX, NgRX, XState, etc. depending on which framework you choose to learn. Certain state management libraries can only be used with specific frameworks - for example, NgRX is a Redux based library that is specifically made for Angular applications.

### Step-6 :- Learn the basics of Package Managers
#### 🕹 While working on Front End Development, you will come across Package Managers. A Package Manager is a tool that allows you to install, configure, update and manage software packages, product dependencies and also to publish your own packages. With the use of Package Managers, the development process is faster and easier as you can reuse code libraries created by other developers that are published to a central repository. NPM and Yarn are two popular package managers. You should learn the basic commands of any of the Package Managers.

### Step-7 :- Learn Version Control System
#### 🕹 A Version Control System is useful if you are working on a large project or need to collaborate with other developers. It is a software that allows you to manage and track changes to the source code and also revert to a previous version of the code, instead of manually reverting the changes. It enhances the development speed and experience as you spend less time managing the code, reduces possibilities of code conflicts, and helps to recover your code in case you want to revert to a previous version. Git is one of the most popular and widely used version control systems.

### Step-8 :- Learn Testing
#### 🕹 While many companies have dedicated Quality Assurance teams for extensive testing of the application, as a developer, you will be expected to perform basic testing of your application to ensure usability and functionality. Writing test cases for your code is a way to ensure that the code is working as expected. This is why software testing is another important skill you need to become a Front End Developer. There are different levels of testing in front-end development like Unit Testing and End-to-End Testing. Several tools are available for testing like Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, Cypress, etc.  

### Step-9 :- Learn Tools for Website Deployment
#### 🕹 Once you have built your website, you need to deploy this website so that anyone on the internet can visit the website and use it. To deploy a website, you will need to know the basics of hosting tools. You can use tools like Github Pages, Heroku, Firebase, Netlify, Vercel, etc. Cloud Providers like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure also provide hosting services.

### Step-10 :- Learn Advanced Topic
#### 🕹 As a front-end developer, you will often build websites that interact with APIs and RESTful or SOAP services. Thus, you can learn about technologies like REST, SOAP, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), etc. that are required when the client (the front end of an application) interacts with the server. 

#### An alternative for REST APIs is GraphQL, which is an open-source data query and manipulation language. It allows developers to make fast and flexible APIs. Using GraphQL enables developers to send requests that can fetch data from multiple sources in a single API call. 

#### Progressive Web App (PWA) is another good-to-know concept using which you can build applications with additional capabilities like the ability to be installed, an app-like interface, push notifications, caching, background-synchronization, etc. 

#### Another good-to-know topic is Static Site Generator (SSG). SSG is a tool that generates HTML websites using a set of templates and raw data. The data in these web pages are static, i.e. they do not change. Thus, they can be pre-built and are ready to be served to users when requested, resulting in faster loading. Developers can use templates to generate web pages automatically. Jekyll, Gatsby, Next.js are few of the commonly used SSGs.
